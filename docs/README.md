# 📚 Documentation

This directory contains additional documentation for the Mem0 Chrome Extension project.

## 📖 Documentation Structure

Currently, the main documentation is consolidated in the root [README.md](../README.md) which contains comprehensive setup instructions, architecture explanations, and usage guides.

### 🎯 Philosophy

Following modern documentation best practices, we keep the main README as the primary entry point with:
- Clear directory structure explanation
- Step-by-step setup instructions  
- CLI command documentation
- Architecture overview
- Contributing guidelines

### 📝 Future Documentation

As the project grows, specific documentation files may be added here:
- `api-reference.md` - Detailed API documentation
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `advanced-configuration.md` - Advanced setup options
- `development-guide.md` - Developer contribution guide
